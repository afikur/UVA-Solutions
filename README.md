# UVA SOLUTIONS

I am Afikur Rahman. Currently I am a senior year student in a Software Engineering program leading to a B.Sc. Degree. This repository contains all the codes that I have solved so far in UVA.

## Caution!

These codes are not the best solutions. But all the codes here has been accepted by UVA. You can read my code. But don't copy and paste. I think that is not going to help anyone.

## Handle

My UVA handle is `afikur`
